          <div className={styles.desc}>
            You and your customers’ privacy are of paramount importance to Neomenta. This privacy policy applies to all
            products and services offered by Neomenta. <br /><br />

            The Neomenta service (hereinafter the Service) is housed on your website and any visitor of your website
            cannot see that the Service has been installed on your website.
            <br /><br />
            Your customers provide you with information during their visits on your website. In that connection the
            Neomenta software may register such information including information which your visitors/customers
            explicitly enter into your website.
            <br /><br />
            Any and all communication with the visitor is a matter between you and your customer. You are obligated to
            comply with any applicable rules on Processing of Personal Data, including the collection, use, storage,
            sharing and protection of your customers’ personal information.
            <br /><br />

            Considering the setup of the Service, you guarantee towards Neomenta that:<br /><br />
            <ul>
              <li>You have obtained any necessary consent in order to transfer the information about your customer from
                You to Neomenta, and
              </li>
              <br />
              <li> You have obtained consent from each of your customers to the data applications, processes and/or
                registrations made by Neomenta.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            Neomenta is only processing and storing data about your customers by your orders. You are the controller of

            Information we gather from you about you and/or your customers: <br /><br />

            <ol>

            </ol>

            exercise control over the sites that may be linked from our website. These other sites may place their own
            cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. <br />
